Question: 

Write a C program that performs matrix addition. 
The program should prompt the user to enter the dimensions (rows and columns) 
for two matrices, M1 and M2. Then, it should allow the user to input the values
for each matrix. After that, it should compute the addition of the matrices 
and display the resulting matrix, M3. How would you modify the provided code 
to achieve this functionality?
