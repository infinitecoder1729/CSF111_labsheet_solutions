Question: 
Write a C program that performs matrix multiplication. 
The program should prompt the user to enter the values for two matrices, 
M1 and M2, and then compute their multiplication, storing the result in matrix M3. 
The dimensions of the matrices are predefined, and the program will 
check if the multiplication is possible based on the dimensions. 

How would you modify the provided code to achieve this functionality?
