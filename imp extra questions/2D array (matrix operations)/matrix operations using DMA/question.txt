Question: 

Write a C program that performs matrix addition and multiplication 
using double pointers and dynamic memory allocation (DMA). 

The program should prompt the user to enter the number of rows and columns 
for two matrices, allocate memory for the matrices using DMA, 
accept the elements of the matrices, perform addition and multiplication operations,
and display the results. Additionally, the program should check for 
compatibility of dimensions before performing the operations.
