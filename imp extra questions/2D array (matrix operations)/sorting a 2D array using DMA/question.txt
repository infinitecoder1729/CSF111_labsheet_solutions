Question: 

Write a C program that receives a 2D array and sorts the elements by accessing 
the 2D array as a 1D array using dynamic memory allocation (DMA). 

The program should prompt the user to enter the number of rows and columns for 
the array, allocate memory for the array using DMA, accept the elements of the array, 
sort the array in ascending order, and display the sorted array.
