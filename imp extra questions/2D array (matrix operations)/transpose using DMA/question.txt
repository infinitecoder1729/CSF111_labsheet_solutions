Question: 

Write a C program that computes the transpose of a given 2D array 
using dynamic memory allocation (DMA). 

The program should prompt the user to enter the number of rows and columns for the matrix,
allocate memory for the matrix using DMA, accept the elements of the matrix,
compute the transpose, and display both the original matrix and its transpose.
