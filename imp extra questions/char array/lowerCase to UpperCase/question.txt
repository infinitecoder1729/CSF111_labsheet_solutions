Question: Write a C program that reads a name character by character 
from the user and converts it to uppercase using the ctype.h library.
 
 The program should prompt the user to enter a name, read each character, 
 store it in an array, and then convert the characters to uppercase 
 using the toupper() function. 
 
 Finally, it should display the uppercase version of the name.
