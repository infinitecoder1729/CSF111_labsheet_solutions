Q: Write a C program to generate a number pyramid pattern.
 The program should ask the user to enter a number
 and then display a pyramid pattern where each row consists of the number repeated 
 according to its row number. 
 
For example, if the user enters 5, the output should be:

    1
   2 2
  3 3 3
 4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5 5

Write a C program to achieve this pattern based on user input.
