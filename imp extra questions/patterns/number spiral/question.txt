Q: Write a C program to display a spiral pattern of a given matrix.
 The program should ask the user to enter the elements of a matrix of size MxN, 
 where M represents the number of rows and N represents the number of columns. 
 It should then print the matrix elements in a spiral pattern, starting from the
 top-left corner and moving inwards towards the center of the matrix. 
 
 Write a C program to achieve this spiral pattern based on user input of matrix elements and size.
 
 For example, if the user enters the marks for each student, 
 and if the matrix size is 5*6,
 the output could be:

Enter the marks for each student:
 //scan
89 75 92 80 95 88
78 82 79 85 91 86
92 87 80 76 88 90
81 85 89 92 84 78
77 83 86 89 92 85
 
 //output
89 75 92 80 95 88 86 90 78 84 92 89 86 83 77 81 92 87 80 76 88 90 78 84 92 89 86 83 77 81 85 89 92 84 78 90 88 95 80 76 88 90 78 84 92 89 86 83 77 81 85 89 92 84 78 90 88 95


Please note that you need to replace ROWS and COLS with the desired values for the matrix size in the #define statements.
