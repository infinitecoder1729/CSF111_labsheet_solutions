Q: Write a C program to generate a palindromic number pattern.
 The program should ask the user to enter a number and then 
 display a pattern where each row consists of numbers that form a palindrome.

For example, if the user enters 5, the output should be:

    1
   212
  32123
 4321234
543212345

Write a C program to achieve this palindromic pattern based on user input.
