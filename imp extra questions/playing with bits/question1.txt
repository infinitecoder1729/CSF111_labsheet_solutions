Q: Write a C program to manipulate bits in an integer. The program should provide the following operations:

1. getBit(n, pos): This function should check the bit at the 
specified position pos in the integer n and print whether the bit is zero or one.

2. setBit(n, pos): This function should set the bit at the 
specified position pos in the integer n and return the updated value.

3. clearBit(n, pos): This function should clear (reset to zero) the bit at 
the specified position pos in the integer n and return the updated value.

4. updateBit(n, pos): This function should ask the user to enter an operation (1 or 0),
 and based on the input, it should either set or clear the bit at the specified position pos
 in the integer n. The updated value of n should be returned.


In the main function, test the above operations by initializing an integer n to 5 and performing the operations on it. Print the results of each operation.

Write a C program to achieve this manipulation of bits based on user input and perform the necessary operations on the integer value.
