Q: Write a C program to toggle a bit in a given number at a specified position.
 The program should ask the user to enter the bit value (0 or 1), the number,
 and the position at which the bit needs to be toggled. The program should then 
 toggle the bit at the specified position in the given number and print the updated number.

 Write a C program to achieve this bit toggling based on user input.

Please note that the code assumes that the positions of bits range from 0 to 7 (8-bit number).
